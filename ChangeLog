Changes in v1.0.12:
* Menu entries are now always sorted alphabetically. On future
  Plasma releases this will include the category list on the right
  of Simple Menu.
* The search field now has a placeholder text.

Changes in v1.0.11:
* Launching apps by touchscreen tap now works.
* An item's highlight decoration now stays in place when opening
  its context menu.
* Resource usage optimizations for an even faster and lighter menu.
* Minor bugfixes.

Changes in v1.0.10:
* Fixed "Add to Favorites" not working as of v1.0.8.

Changes in v1.0.9:
* Fixed a bug causing system action buttons to stay highlighted
  when the mouse pointer leaves the area.

Changes in v1.0.8:
* Made switching categories by hovering them optional. You can now
  turn it off in the settings.
* Custom panel button images now work better. They're smoothly
  scaled, and square images are automatically rounded to crisp sizes
  just like normal icons are.
* The UI for setting custom button images now uses the regular icon
  picker dialog (it supports custom images in recent releases of the
  KDE Frameworks libraries) and you can also set a custom button
  image by just dropping it on the config area.
* Speed optimizations to make the menu open faster and speed up
  switching of categories.
* Fixed hovering a menu item interfering with arrow keyboard navi-
  gation on newer versions of Qt.

Changes in v1.0.7:
* Fixed arrow navigation through the search results after entering
  search terms not working.
* Improved arrow navigation while searching: Previously, it was
  necessary to arrow down into the results after entering search
  terms before horizontal arrow navigation through the search
  results would work. This was changed, so that e.g. arrow right
  will now immediately move to the second search result, for a
  more friction-free search and launch experience.
* Tab and Shift+Tab can now be used to cycle through the search
  field, the system favorites (Shutdown & co) and the category
  list.

Changes in v1.0.6:
* Fixed triggering context menu actions.

Changes in v1.0.5:
* Speed optimizations to open the menu faster.

Changes in v1.0.4:
* Fixed menu appearing on the wrong monitor in multi-monitor setups.
* Fixed crash when opening the context menu for search result items.

Changes in v1.0.3:
* Fix favorites on Plasma 5.11 and support the new globally shared
  favorites and unique per-activity favorites.

Changes in v1.0.2:
* Made sure initial arrow key press always selects first item.
* Polished search experience: First search result is selected while
  searching, no longer requiring extra key presses to launch.
* Fixed auto-hide panels not staying open while Simple Menu is open.
* Support for the panel icon size hint in Frameworks 5, prevents panel
  icon getting too large in wide panels.
* Fixed panel icon missing mouseover highlight effect.
* Now requiring KDE Frameworks v5.34.
